The purpose of this project was to test all systems, including the arduino and relating software. 
The guidelines and code for the project was taken from a book called the Arduino Project Handbook by Mark Geddes 

Code: 
/* http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite by Tom Igoe
from http:itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/AnalogIn */ 

int potPin = A0; // Analog input pin(A0) connected to the potentiometer
int potValue = 0; // Sets a varaible for the value that will be read from the potentiometer
int led = 9; // Pin 9 (connected to the LED) is capable of of PWM

//Runs once at the beginning of the program
void setup() { 
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // set pin 9 as an output pin calibrated for a led
  }
 
//loops continuously 
 void loop() {
  portValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read potentiometer value from A0 pin
  analogwrite(led, potValue/4); // Send potentimeter value to LED 
  delay(10); // Wait for 10 ms
      
Project Notes:
  The first trial lead to the LED working, however, the potentiometer had no effect on the led whatsoever. The
  led was noted to flicker when jolted, so it suspected that the premade wires may have been faulty. Futhermore, the 
  metal clips may have been in contact with the casing of the potentiometer, thus creating a short circuit.
