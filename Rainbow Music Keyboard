The goal of this project was to create a device capable of playing musical notes while lighting up a sequence of correspounding LEDS. 
This edition works, however, the music importation system is awakward and leads to user errors as typing long seris of letters and numbers
leads to easy mistakes. Addtionally, switching music requires a rewrite of the program. 

This project was created in effort to establish a firm ground in ardunio outputs. Future verisons will allow user input; including 
a way to streamline the musical interperation process and a way for the user to set the tone. 

Code: 
int speakerPin = 11; //establishes the pin output for speaker; important that pin 11 is capable of producting analog signal

int length = 4; //length of the music notes, must be equal to total number of notes + music; edit to change music length
char notes[] = "gage "; // a space represents a rest, corrlates with the music scale; edit to change spefic musical tones
int beats[] = {2, 1, 1, 2, 2}; //length a spefic note is played, spaces included; edit to change note length
int tempo = 300; //"speed" of the music; increase to increase music speed

int LED1 = 2; //establishing outputs for each of the leds; leds are arranged on a row on the breadboard (insert image) 
int LED2 = 3;
int LED3 = 4;
int LED4 = 5;
int LED5 = 6;
int LED6 = 7; 
int LED7 = 8; 
int LED8 = 9;
int LED9 = 10; 
int LED10 = 12;

  for (long i = 0; i < duration * 1000L; i += tone * 2) {
    digitalWrite(speakerPin, HIGH); //output speaker on 
    delayMicroseconds(tone); //delay
    digitalWrite(speakerPin, LOW); //output speaker off
    delayMicroseconds(tone); // //delay 
  }
}

void playNote(char note, int duration) { //establishes interpreation between the notes and analog tone
