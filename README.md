# capstone-arduino-

The capstone arduino project is the documentation for a independent high school project focusing on exploring the possible uses of the arduino. Practically, this project exists in two parts; one, learning how to operate the features of an arduino, and two, applying these principles to create a portfolio of small devices.


This project is meant for the project owner's own personal use, and therefore is not allied with any corporation or intended for monetary gain.
