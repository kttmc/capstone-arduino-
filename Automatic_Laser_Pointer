//The purpose of this experiment was to test the strength and programming function of some new servos 
//To test the servos, an "automatic laser pointer" was created; basically, a toy laser pointer mounted on a servo, standing freely
//on a cardboard stand. 
//The lazer was designed in order to entertain a cat, requiring that it both move itself randomly in order to remain engaging, 
//but also remain slow enough that the cat would not become frustrated. To accomplish this, a two step pattern was created; 
//a randomly determined "large movement" between 0 and 30 degrees, as well as a one degree "smaller movement" in order to shake the laser
//and allow the cat to catch up.

//Code: 


#include <Servo.h>  //include the servo libary 

Servo servoone;  // create servo object to control a servo
int degree;    // variable to store the degree of the moving part of the servo



void setup() {
  servoone.attach(9);  // sets servo to pin 9 
}

//to move the lazer across large distances randomly 
void loop() {
  degree = random(0, 30);       //selects a random value between zero and 30
  servoone.write(degree);      // sets the servo position according to the randomly determined value 
  delay(2000);                 //delay for 2000 ms 

//in order to slow down the movement of the lazer dot
  for(int i = 0; i <= degree; i++) { //for the number of the degree that the servo turned
    servoone.write(1);   //turn one degree 
    delay(20);           //delay 
  }
}
