//The purpose of this experiment was to not create a stand-alone project, but to test the strength and function of some new servos
//In order to do this, I created a automatic lazer pointer, mounted on a servo. The stand and physical mounting was created using 
//cardboard and tape 

//Code: 


#include <Servo.h>  //include the servo libary 

Servo servoone;  // create servo object to control a servo
int degree;    // variable to store the degree of the moving part of the servo



void setup() {
  servoone.attach(9);  // sets servo to pin 9 
}

//to move the lazer across large distances randomly 
void loop() {
  degree = random(0, 30);       //selects a random value between zero and 30
  servoone.write(degree);      // sets the servo position according to the randomly determined value 
  delay(2000);                 //delay for 2000 ms 

//in order to slow down the movement of the lazer dot
  for(int i = 0; i <= degree; i++) { //for the number of the degree that the servo turned
    servoone.write(1);   //turn one degree 
    delay(20);           //delay 
  }
}
