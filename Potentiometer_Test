//The purpose of this project was to serve as a test for all systems, including the arduino and relating software, rather
//than a separate, stand-alone project.
//The guidelines and code for the project was taken from a book called the Arduino Project Handbook by Mark Geddes 

//Code: 
/* http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite by Tom Igoe
from http:itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/AnalogIn */ 

int potPin = A0; // Analog input pin(A0) connected to the potentiometer
int potValue = 0; // Sets a varaible for the value that will be read from the potentiometer
int led = 9; // Pin 9 (connected to the LED) is capable of of PWM

//Runs once at the beginning of the program
void setup() { 
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // set pin 9 as an output pin calibrated for a led
  }
 
//loops continuously 
 void loop() {
  portValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read potentiometer value from A0 pin
  analogwrite(led, potValue/4); // Send potentimeter value to LED 
  delay(10); // Wait for 10 ms
      
//Project Notes:
  /* The first trial lead to the LED working, however, the potentiometer had no effect on the led whatsoever. The
  led was noted to flicker when jolted, so it suspected that the premade wires may have been faulty. Futhermore, the 
  metal clips may have been in contact with the casing of the potentiometer, thus creating a short circuit- this was confirmed 
  via a photo taken with a photo taken to docoment the project. 
  
  The secound trial was repeated with a different potentiometer and careful positioning of wires to prevent the short 
  circuitry through the potentiometer. Stability was further increased by replacing old premade jumper wires with self made ones. This
  lead to no improvement, however, the computer was noted to reconnect and disconnect with the with the arduino constantly. 
  This lead to a diagnoius of either two issues, one, circuit build quailty, or two, a problem with the arduino itself. 
  
  The third trial was preformed with all above changes, as well as the diagonstic protocol performed in issue 1 
  (https://github.com/kttmc/capstone-arduino-/issues/1). This resulted in a working circuit; the problem was build quailty- most
  likely a specifically found jumper wire that was not stripped correctly. */
